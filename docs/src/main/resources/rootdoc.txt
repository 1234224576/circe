This is the Scaladoc for [[http://circe.io circe]], a JSON library for Scala
and Scala.js.

The library is divided into several modules each focusing on various aspects
of working with JSON as well as codecs for 3rd party libraries. Noteworthy
modules are:

 - The [[io.circe core]] module, which is focused on the JSON AST, zippers,
   and codecs.
 - The [[io.circe.generic generic]] module for automatic and semi-automatic
   [[https://circe.github.io/circe/codec.html derivation]] of encoders and
   decoders.
 - The [[io.circe.optics optics]] module providing an alternative way to
   traverse JSON documents using lenses.
 - The [[io.circe.shapes shapes]] module for working with Shapeless.

Please refer to the [[https://circe.github.io/circe/ documentation]] for a
detailed introduction to circe.
